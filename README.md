# Sales Analysis Project
Using the Adventure Works sample dataset, a mock business request was created to ask certain business needs such as products sold and budget versus revenue. The data was cleaned and prepared in several Excel documents. A tableau dashboard was created to illustrate the business needs. 

# Business Problem 
Steven  - Sales Manager:

Hi Jonathan!

I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time.
Seeing as we are primarily based in the United States, it would be beneficial to see the sales of each city.
We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance. 
The budget is for 2022 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.
Let me know if you need anything else!

# Analysis 
The finished dashboard contains a visualization that provides an overview of the sales by product category, sales by top 10 customers, sales by top 10 products, budget versus sales and sales by city. The visualization can be fileted through the customerâ€™s city, product category and year.
